Emacs Shell Integration

The aim for this project is a better integration of GNU Emacs into the Windows Desktop Environment. The program generates all required resgistry items for a powerfull usage of the editor.

Requirements
The script language Ruby has to be installed before you can use this script. Use Ruby 1.9.3-p484 from http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/.

What does this?
The script generates a registry file to import within regedit32.exe. The same time also a registry file for removing the items is generated.

- all registry items are located under registry hive HKEY_CURRENT_USER
- generated file definitions are
  - Emacs.TextFile (*.txr)
  - Emacs.LispSource (*.el)
  - Emacs.LispByteCode (*.elc)
- define enviroment variables to use emacs in server mode
- create keys for a couple of source file definitions to add emacs as optional editor

Documentation
Help can be found with emacs-shell-integration.rb --help.

Language
All context menu items are in plain English. To use your local language see emacs-shell-languages.yaml for further addition. You select the language with parameter --language <lang-short>.
